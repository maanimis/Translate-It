## Core Components

### 1. `composables/useTTSSmart.js` - The Unified TTS Composable
The **single source of truth** for all TTS functionality across the entire extension. This composable encapsulates all client-side TTS logic, manages state, coordinates with background services, and provides complete playback control.

**✅ Unified Features (2025):**
- **Single State Management**: Manages 5 distinct states: `'idle' | 'loading' | 'playing' | 'paused' | 'error'`
- **Complete Control Methods**: `speak()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `stop()`, `stopAll()`, and `retry()`
- **Reactive Properties**: `canPause`, `canResume`, `canStop`, `isPlaying`, `isLoading` for UI updates
- **Language Fallback System**: Automatically maps unsupported languages (e.g., `fa → ar`)
- **Cross-Context Exclusive Playback**: Automatic coordination between Popup, Sidepanel, WindowsManager
- **Intelligent Error Recovery**: Built-in retry mechanisms and user-friendly error messages
- **UnifiedMessaging Integration**: Optimized timeouts and reliable background communication

### 2. `components/shared/TTSButton.vue`
A smart UI component that provides a rich visual experience based on the TTS state.

**Visual States:**
1.  **Idle**: 🔊 Default play icon.
2.  **Loading**: 🔊 Gentle spinning animation.
3.  **Playing**: ⏸️ Pause icon with a circular progress ring.
4.  **Paused**: ▶️ Resume icon.
5.  **Error**: 🔊 Red icon with a tooltip, indicating a problem.

### 3. Language Fallback System
**✅ New Feature (2025)**: Automatic language mapping for enhanced compatibility.

**Supported Fallbacks:**
```javascript
const ttsLanguageFallbacks = {
  'fa': 'ar', // Persian → Arabic (similar script and phonetics)
  'ps': 'ar', // Pashto → Arabic
  'ku': 'ar', // Kurdish → Arabic  
  'ur': 'ar', // Urdu → Arabic
  'yi': 'he', // Yiddish → Hebrew
  'hy': 'ru', // Armenian → Russian
  'ka': 'ru', // Georgian → Russian
  'az': 'tr', // Azerbaijani → Turkish
  // ... and more
};
```

**Benefits:**
- **No HTTP 400 Errors**: Languages like Persian now work seamlessly
- **Better User Experience**: Users hear audio in phonetically similar languages
- **Automatic Fallback**: No manual configuration required

### 4. Background & Messaging

#### `messaging/core/MessageActions.js`
The messaging system has been optimized with unified actions to support the enhanced controls:
- `GOOGLE_TTS_SPEAK`
- `GOOGLE_TTS_PAUSE`
- `GOOGLE_TTS_RESUME`
- `TTS_STOP` (unified smart stop action handling both specific and global stops)
- `GOOGLE_TTS_GET_STATUS`
- `GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED` (completion event for proper lifecycle management)

#### `background/handlers/tts/handleGoogleTTS.js`
The background handler has been enhanced with centralized configuration, smart stop logic, and event-driven notifications:
- **Centralized Configuration (v2.5)**: Now utilizes a dedicated constants file (`googleTTS.js`) for URLs, supported languages, and text cleaning logic, significantly improving maintainability.
- **Smart Stop Handler**: `handleGoogleTTSStopAll` now handles both specific TTS stops (with `ttsId`) and global stops (without `ttsId`)
- **Persistent TTS ID**: `currentTTSId` now persists throughout audio playback and is only cleared when audio actually ends or is explicitly stopped
- **Completion Event Handling**: `handleGoogleTTSEnded` ensures proper cleanup when TTS audio completes naturally
- **Enhanced Notification System**: Added `notifyTTSEnded` function with reason-based notifications (completed, interrupted, stopped)
- **Sender Tracking**: `currentTTSSender` tracks original requester for targeted event delivery
- **Cross-Browser Audio Management**: Communicates with Offscreen documents (Chrome) or direct audio (Firefox) for precise control
- **MessageActions Constants**: Uses `MessageActions.GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED` instead of hardcoded strings for maintainability

## 🔄 State Management & Lifecycle Rules

The system's intelligence lies in its strict state and lifecycle management.

### Exclusive Playback
A core principle of the new system: **only one TTS instance can be active at any given time**. When a user initiates a new playback, the `TTSGlobalManager` automatically finds and stops any currently playing or paused instance before starting the new one. This prevents audio overlap and creates a predictable user experience.

### Smart Lifecycle
The `TTSGlobalManager` enforces context-aware rules:
- **Popup / Windows Manager**: TTS is automatically stopped if the component's UI is closed or hidden.
- **Sidepanel**: TTS is allowed to persist even when the user switches to a different browser tab, as the sidepanel remains visible.
- **Browser Close**: All TTS instances are stopped when the browser window is about to be unloaded.
- **ID Persistence**: `currentTTSId` persists throughout audio playback duration, ensuring reliable stop functionality from any component.

## ⚠️ Error Handling and Recovery

The system features a multi-layered error handling and recovery strategy.

**Error Types Handled:**
- `NETWORK_ERROR`
- `AUDIO_CONTEXT_ERROR`
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`
- `LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED`
- And 3+ other specific errors.

**Recovery Strategies:**
- **Auto-Retry**: For transient issues like network errors, the system automatically retries up to 2 times.
- **Manual Retry**: If an error persists, the `TTSButton` enters an error state, allowing the user to trigger a manual retry.
- **Language Fallback**: If a language is not supported, it automatically falls back to English ('en') to provide feedback.

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

The system maintains seamless cross-browser support by abstracting the audio playback mechanism.
- **Chromium-based Browsers (Chrome, Edge)**: Utilizes an **Offscreen Document** to play audio, complying with Manifest V3's restrictions on background service workers.
- **Firefox**: Plays audio **directly from the background script** using the standard Audio API, as Firefox's MV3 implementation allows it.

The `handleGoogleTTS.js` handler and `TTSGlobalManager` are unaware of the underlying implementation detail, allowing for a clean and maintainable architecture.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Empty response from offscreen document" Errors
**Symptoms**: Console shows empty response errors but audio still plays
**Root Cause**: Chrome MV3 messaging timing issues
**Solution**: These errors are now handled gracefully - the system assumes success and relies on completion events
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved in v1.5** - No user action needed

#### TTS Button Stuck in Error State  
**Symptoms**: Button shows error icon despite audio playing correctly
**Root Cause**: Response timing mismatch between offscreen and background
**Solution**: Updated to event-driven architecture with proper state management
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved in v1.5** - No user action needed

#### Multiple TTS Requests on Single Click
**Symptoms**: Multiple identical requests in console logs
**Root Cause**: Duplicate `speak()` calls in retry mechanism  
**Solution**: Fixed `TTSButton.vue` to call only `retry()` which handles `speak()` internally
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved in v1.5** - No user action needed

#### Audio Cuts Off or Fails to Start
**Symptoms**: Race conditions during rapid TTS requests
**Root Cause**: Null pointer exceptions during concurrent audio cleanup
**Solution**: Added null safety checks in offscreen document audio handling
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved in v1.5** - No user action needed

#### Inconsistent Styling Across Components
**Symptoms**: TTS buttons look different in Popup vs WindowsManager
**Root Cause**: WindowsManager used standalone TTSButton instead of ActionToolbar
**Solution**: Standardized all components to use ActionToolbar with consistent CSS
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved** - All components now have uniform styling

#### "TTS failed" Errors with Working Audio
**Symptoms**: Frontend shows TTS failed errors but audio plays correctly
**Root Cause**: ReliableMessaging port fallback returned message wrapper instead of actual result data
**Solution**: Fixed ReliableMessaging to extract `result` from port messages properly
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved in v1.6** - Port communication now returns correct response data

#### "No response received for GOOGLE_TTS_STOP_ALL" Timeout Errors
**Symptoms**: Console shows timeout errors for `GOOGLE_TTS_STOP_ALL` action, particularly in PopupApp lifecycle cleanup
**Root Cause**: PopupApp.vue bypassed the unified TTS system and used legacy `GOOGLE_TTS_STOP_ALL` action directly
**Solution**: Updated PopupApp.vue to use `MessageActions.TTS_STOP` like the unified system (TTSButton → useTTSSmart)
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved in v2.1** - All components now use consistent TTS stop mechanism

#### WindowsManager TTS Stop Button Not Working
**Symptoms**: Clicking the TTS stop button in WindowsManager does not stop the audio, though window closure works correctly
**Root Cause**: `currentTTSId` was being cleared prematurely in the `finally` block of the TTS speak handler, before audio actually finished playing
**Solution**: 
- Removed `currentTTSId` cleanup from `finally` block in `handleGoogleTTSSpeak`
- Added `currentTTSId = null` in Firefox `audio.onended` handler
- Created `handleGoogleTTSEnded` handler for Chrome completion events
- Registered `GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED` message handler in LifecycleManager
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved in v2.2** - TTS ID now persists throughout audio playback, enabling reliable stop functionality

#### WindowsManager TTS Stop Button Enhancement (v2.2)
**Changes Implemented**:
- **Optimized Debug Logs**: Streamlined logging messages for better readability and reduced console noise
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Added detailed debug information including current TTS ID when stop requests are skipped
- **Improved Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for v2.2 changes and architecture decisions

**Technical Details**:
- Debug logs reduced from verbose emoji-heavy format to concise, readable format
- Error responses now include `currentTTSId` for better debugging capabilities
- Documentation updated with clear explanation of TTS ID lifecycle management

**Status**: ✅ **Enhanced in v2.2.1** - Better debugging experience and improved error handling

#### 🔧 Critical Event-Driven Completion Fix (v2.4)
**Problem**: TTS completion events (`GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED`) were being dispatched by offscreen document but no handler was registered, causing the system to fall back to timeout-based completion detection.

**Root Cause**:
- `GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED` handler was **NOT registered** in LifecycleManager's `registerMessageHandlers()`
- Lazy loading system was missing `handleGoogleTTSEnded` from loaded handlers

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// 1. Registered handler in LifecycleManager.js
'GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED': Handlers.handleTTSEndedLazy,

// 2. Created lazy handler wrapper in handleTTSLazy.js
export const handleTTSEndedLazy = async (message, sender) => {
  const { handleGoogleTTSEnded } = await loadTTSHandlers();
  return await handleGoogleTTSEnded(message, sender);
};

// 3. Added to loaded handlers
const handlers = {
  handleGoogleTTSSpeak: googleTTS.handleGoogleTTSSpeak,
  handleGoogleTTSStopAll: googleTTS.handleGoogleTTSStopAll,
  handleGoogleTTSEnded: googleTTS.handleGoogleTTSEnded, // ← Added
  handleOffscreenReady: offscreenReady.handleOffscreenReady
};
```

**Impact**:
- **🚀 Immediate Response**: TTS button now responds immediately when audio completes
- **📊 Reduced Timeout Reliance**: Adaptive timeout (1-30s) now serves as true safety net
- **⚡ Better Performance**: No more 30-second waits for short words like "Process"
- **🎯 Event-Driven Architecture**: Restored intended event-driven completion system

**Status**: ✅ **Fixed in v2.4** - Event-driven completion now working properly with adaptive timeouts

### Centralized Configuration & Enhanced Reliability (v2.5)
- **🎯 Centralized Constants**: Moved all Google TTS configuration (Base URL, supported languages, offscreen path) to a dedicated `src/features/tts/constants/googleTTS.js` file.
- **🛡️ Global Cleaning Logic**: Centralized the `TTS_CLEANING_REGEX` to ensure consistent text preprocessing across all contexts, specifically supporting Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Latin-accented characters.
- **🔗 Smart URL Construction**: Implemented `getGoogleTTSUrl` helper to safely generate TTS requests with proper encoding and parameters.
- **📏 Configurable Limits**: Added `MAX_TTS_TEXT_LENGTH` and other tuning parameters to a single location for easier system-wide adjustments.

### Major Improvements in v2.4 (Latest)

The TTS system has been significantly enhanced with event-driven architecture and improved reliability:

#### Event-Driven Completion System (Critical Fix)
- **✅ Fixed Handler Registration**: `GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED` handler now properly registered in LifecycleManager
- **Eliminated Polling**: Replaced 500ms polling mechanism with event-driven `GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED` notifications
- **🚀 Adaptive Timeout System**: Intelligent timeout based on text length and language (1-30 seconds)
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduced background checks and improved resource utilization

#### Adaptive Timeout Algorithm
The system now uses smart timeout calculation instead of fixed 30-second timeouts:

```javascript
// Text-based timeout calculation
const calculateAdaptiveTimeout = (text, language) => {
  const readingSpeeds = {
    'en': 200, 'fa': 150, 'ar': 150, 'zh': 280, 'ja': 300, // WPM/CPM
    'default': 180
  };

  const contentUnits = ['ja', 'zh', 'ko'].includes(language)
    ? text.length
    : text.trim().split(/\s+/).length;

  const estimatedSeconds = (contentUnits / readingSpeeds[language]) * 60;
  const minTimeout = text.length <= 5 ? 1 : 2; // 1s for very short texts
  const maxTimeout = 30; // Maximum 30 seconds
  const timeoutWithBuffer = Math.max(minTimeout, Math.min(maxTimeout, estimatedSeconds * 3));

  return Math.ceil(timeoutWithBuffer * 1000); // Convert to milliseconds
};
```

**Timeout Examples:**
- **Single words** ("Hello"): **1 second**
- **Short words** ("Process"): **2 seconds**
- **Medium sentences**: **~5 seconds**
- **Long paragraphs**: **~18 seconds**
- **Very long texts**: **30 seconds (maximum)**

#### Enhanced Notification System
- **Reason-Based Notifications**: Added support for `completed`, `interrupted`, and `stopped` reasons
- **Targeted Event Delivery**: `currentTTSSender` ensures events reach the original requester
- **Proper Interruption Handling**: New TTS requests notify previous sender of interruption

#### Code Quality Improvements
- **MessageActions Constants**: Replaced hardcoded strings with `MessageActions.GOOGLE_TTS_ENDED`
- **Unified Notification Function**: Centralized `notifyTTSEnded` function for consistent behavior
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error recovery and logging throughout the system

#### Technical Details
- **Firefox Support**: Direct audio completion events sent via `runtime.sendMessage`
- **Chrome Support**: Offscreen document events properly forwarded to original requester
- **Cross-Context Communication**: Proper handling between content scripts, popups, and sidepanels

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check Extension Console**: Look for TTS-related logs with component prefixes
2. **Verify Version**: Ensure offscreen document shows "Version 1.6" in console  
3. **Test Across Components**: Verify TTS works in Popup, Sidepanel, and WindowsManager
4. **Monitor Network**: Check if Google TTS URLs are accessible
5. **Extension Reload**: Disable/enable extension if issues persist

### System Unification Verification (2025)

To verify the TTS system is properly unified:
- ✅ **Single Composable**: Only `useTTSSmart.js` used across all contexts
- ✅ **No Legacy Code**: `TTSManager.js` completely removed (~600 lines eliminated)
- ✅ **WindowsManager Simplified**: No dual TTS implementations
- ✅ **TranslationWindow Unified**: Single composable approach
- ✅ **Language Fallbacks**: Persian/Kurdish languages work seamlessly  
- ✅ **Consistent State Management**: All components use unified `tts.ttsState.value`
- ✅ **Unified Methods**: All contexts use `tts.speak()`, `tts.stop()`, `tts.retry()`, etc.
- ✅ **UnifiedMessaging**: Optimized timeout management for TTS operations

### Architecture Validation

The unified system is considered healthy when:
- ✅ **Zero Legacy Code**: No `TTSManager.js` references in codebase
